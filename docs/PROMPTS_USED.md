# PROMPTS_USED.md

This document records all user prompts and instructions given to GitHub Copilot or other AI agents during the development of the Search Agent project. Each entry is timestamped and lightly edited for clarity. Agents should update this document with every new prompt or instruction received, ensuring an accurate and chronological log of user interactions for future reference and project traceability.

### Prompt 1
The instructions.

### Prompt 2
The instructions in Readme are for deploying manually. But we're deploying it using the terraform script, so I don't want to keep the manual instructions just for information, but I also want to add instructions for using terraform. So can you please add a section to the readme for this?

### Prompt 3
Update the SSH -i commands to the actual values. You will find the actual values in step two.

### Prompt 4
Update Copilot Journal for what you have done today. The document will guide you to the current format.

### Prompt 5
I want to maintain the prompts used document to document all the prompts that I have been using in the session. So are you able to update the document with all the prompts that you received in this session? But timestamp it as well. And you can make small corrections to grammar and spelling and punctuation so that it reads nicely but keep to the original.

### Prompt 6
Update the prompts used document with a description at the top so we know what it is when we look at it next time. And an agent can accurately update these instructions whenever it works for me on this project.

### Prompt 7
If there have been new prompts since this document was updated last, can you add them?

### Prompt 8
You may have to compare the text to be certain which was the last prompt.
